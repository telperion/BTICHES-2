# Bubble Tea Invitational Co-Host's Exciting Sightreadables II

## Welcome (and thanks for waiting!)

Seriously, I'm so sorry about the wait lol. BTI 2 was held in December 2016 and it's now August 2019. I've sat on these files for so long that most people forgot I even had them - but I didn't have the motivation (or, honestly, the time to mentally clear and dedicate to it) to polish and round out the pack until pretty recently. I hope you enjoy this historically accurate four-panel sampler.

And also one bonus file that was not used in the tournament. For hopefully obvious reasons.

These were originally used in a sightreading tournament, so the technical content is generally pretty low. Probably good for FA+ or a nice casual sesh. There's crossovers in basically everything (it's California, c'mon) so I only pointed them out when there were significant instances or a high density.
